You've made it this far, keep it up!
These are vendos, which sell useful Habitat items.
To buy things, GET on yourself, which will open your pocket,
and select the blue coins inside.
If you PUT them into a vendo, it will sell you one of these
items, which you can use to customize your Avatar.
If you'd like to see what's for sale, DO on the vendo,
which will show the next available item.
